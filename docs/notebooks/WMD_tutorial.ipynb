    "# Word Mover's Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is a new method that seeks to find the distance between two sets of words (documents, sentences, etc.). The method uses word embeddings via word2vec, and the rest is quite intuitive: match the closest words and sum the distances between them. Another way of saying it is that we find the \"minimum traveling distance\" from one document to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "WMD is illustrated below for two very similar sentences. The sentences have no words in common (non-trivial ones), but by matching the relevant words, WMD is able to accurately measure the similarity between the two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://vene.ro/images/wmd-obama.png' height='700' width='700'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method comes from the article \"From Word Embeddings To Document Distances\" by Matt Kusner et al. ([link to PDF](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/kusnerb15.pdf)). It is inspired by the \"Earth Mover's Distance\", and employs a solver of the \"transportation problem\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This short tutorial shows the use of the `wmdistance` method of the Gensim `Word2Vec` class. Stay tuned for another tutorial in kNN classification using Gensim's [docsim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/similarities/docsim.html), when this functionality is implemented!\n",

    "## Using WMD\n",
    "\n",
    "To use WMD, we need some word embeddings first of all. You could train a word2vec (see tutorial [here](http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/)) model on some corpus, but in this tutorial we will simply download some pre-trained word2vec embeddings. Download these embeddings [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit). Training your own embeddings can be beneficial, but to simplify this tutorial, we will be using pre-trained embeddings.\n",
